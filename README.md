**As a collaborator**
 1. Make a **new branch** on this repository
 2. Make your changes
 3. Make a pull request, and **leave it alone**.
 4. (optional) label it "PR: Merging" or "PR: Ready"

When someone decides we have enough PRs and is **willing** to go through the fucking merge hell:
 1. Make a **new** branch on your local machines.
 2. Pull each pr **one by one** into your new branch.
 3. Merge as necessary.
 4. Record each change into the file `changelog`
 5. Update the version in `cmakelists.txt`

#### Standards
##### Indentation
We are using tabs for indentations. Don't like it? I don't either, but it's our *standard* so please fucking follow it.
Fortunately, we are allowed to use spaces to align code. Will this cause a mess aligning using different tab sizes? *Yes.* So let's all
agree to use tabsize=8, alright? I didn't decide this one.

gTorrent uses astyle to format our code. You can find more about it [here](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/)

Install astyle, and then run scripts/format.sh at the root of the repo, so that someone else doesn't have to fix your retarded indents

##### Coding style
We are using our own, loosely based of kernel style. If something's not specified here, either follow what others have done or use your better judgement
- If/else statements get their opening braces (Don't ask why, I hate this one too.)
- Functions get their own opening braces.
- Avoid stupid fucking sepples shitty meta programming templates whenever possible.
